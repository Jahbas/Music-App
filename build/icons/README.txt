Place your custom app.ico music icon in this folder as app.ico before running npm run build.

Current source artwork:
- app.svg — audio/music note icon (vector). You can edit/export this in an icon editor (e.g. Figma, Inkscape) and export a Windows .ico with multiple sizes (16/32/48/64/128/256) and a transparent background.

Recommended steps to keep the background translucent in the .ico:
1. Import app.svg into your editor.
2. Ensure the canvas/background layer is transparent (no solid fill).
3. Export as a .ico file with an alpha channel (transparent background) and place it here as app.ico.
